/**
 * There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
 * Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(n+m)).
 * nums1 and nums2 cannot be empty.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * nums1 = [1, 3]
 * nums2 = [2]
 * The median is 2.0
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * nums1 = [1, 2]
 * nums2 = [3, 4]
 * The median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 * nums2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10]
 * THe median is 2.5
